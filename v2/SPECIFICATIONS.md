# Project Specifications - v2: AI Testing Web Application

This document describes the requirements for a web-based AI testing application that allows users to test OpenAI models and neural network capabilities through a browser interface.

## Project Overview

Create a local web application that provides an interface for testing AI capabilities. Users should be able to run the application locally and access it through their web browser to perform different types of AI tests without needing command-line interaction.

The application serves as a demonstration platform for AI capabilities, making complex AI testing accessible through a simple web interface.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Web Application Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Provide a local web server with browser-based interface

**Requirements**:
- Run locally on user's machine
- Accessible through web browser (localhost)
- Responsive interface that works on desktop browsers
- Clean, intuitive user interface
- Real-time feedback for long-running operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

**Expected Behavior**:
- Application starts with a simple command
- User can navigate to localhost URL to access interface
- All functionality accessible through web browser
- No command-line interaction required for testing
- Graceful handling of server errors and API failures

### 2. OpenAI Model Testing

**Purpose**: Allow users to test different OpenAI models with custom queries

**Requirements**:
- Model selection interface with at least 2 options (GPT-4o and GPT-o3)
- Text input area for user queries
- Submit functionality to send queries to selected model
- Display response from OpenAI API
- Show model used and response metadata (tokens, timing, etc.)
- Handle API errors gracefully

**User Workflow**:
1. User selects desired OpenAI model from dropdown/radio buttons
2. User enters query text in input field
3. User clicks submit to send query
4. Application displays loading indicator while processing
5. Application shows response, model used, and metadata
6. User can submit additional queries or change models

**Expected Information Display**:
- Selected model name
- User query (echoed back)
- AI response text
- Response time
- Token usage (if available)
- Error messages if API call fails

### 3. Neural Network Architecture Testing

**Purpose**: Generate and test a basic neural network on the server

**Requirements**:
- Generate a 4-layer deep neural network architecture
- Create and initialize the network on the server
- Test that the server can successfully run the model
- Display network architecture information
- Show test results (success/failure of model execution)
- Demonstrate basic forward pass functionality

**Architecture Specifications**:
- 4-layer deep network structure
- Appropriate for demonstration purposes
- Should work on both CPU and GPU (if available)
- Include basic activation functions
- Generate synthetic test data for validation

**Expected Behavior**:
- User clicks button to generate network
- Application creates 4-layer network architecture
- Application displays network specifications (layer sizes, activations, parameters)
- Application tests forward pass with sample data
- Application reports success/failure and basic performance metrics
- Show whether GPU or CPU was used for computation

## User Experience Requirements

### Interface Layout
- Single page application with distinct sections for each test
- Each section should have its own action/run button
- Clean, minimal design focused on functionality
- Both tests should be equally prominent on the page

### Results Display
- Results display inline below the test controls or to the right of the setup area
- No history functionality required - focus on current test results
- Results should be clearly formatted and easy to read
- No modal popups or separate pages needed

### User Interaction Flow
- Tests can be run independently of each other
- Each test has its own run button for immediate execution
- Users can run tests multiple times without page refresh
- No queuing or batch execution needed

## Technical Requirements

### OpenAI Integration
- Users input custom prompts through a text area
- Display basic response metadata (model used, response time, token usage if available)
- No API cost tracking or rate limiting display required
- No caching or storage of responses needed

### Neural Network Specifications
- Fixed CNN architecture with fully connected layers
- Use basic Inception-based architecture (4 layers total)
- Success criteria: CUDA compatibility check, model fits in memory, successful forward pass
- Generate synthetic test data for demonstration
- Display architecture details and memory usage (percentage and GB)
- Show device used (CPU/GPU) and basic performance metrics

### Configuration Management
- API keys stored in config directory in project root
- Users manually copy API key to config file
- Auto-detect available compute resources (GPU/CPU)
- Basic logging to console for debugging
- Include .gitignore to prevent API key upload to repository

## Performance Criteria

### Response Times
- OpenAI API calls should complete within 60 seconds or timeout gracefully
- Neural network generation should complete within 30 seconds
- Web interface should be responsive (page loads < 3 seconds)
- Real-time feedback for operations taking longer than 5 seconds

### Resource Usage
- Application should run on typical development machines
- Minimal memory footprint when idle
- Efficient handling of concurrent requests (if multiple users)
- Graceful degradation when GPU unavailable

## Security Requirements

### API Key Management
- Secure handling of OpenAI API keys
- No exposure of credentials in client-side code
- Clear instructions for secure configuration
- Validation of API keys before use

### Web Security
- Basic protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Safe handling of API responses
- No exposure of server internals in error messages

## Installation and Setup Requirements

### Environment Setup
- Simple installation process (single command preferred)
- Clear documentation for dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Virtual environment or containerization support

### Configuration
- Easy configuration process for API credentials
- Sensible defaults for all settings
- Validation of configuration before starting server
- Clear error messages for misconfiguration

### Startup Process
- Single command to start the web server
- Clear indication when server is ready
- Automatic browser opening (optional)
- Graceful shutdown capability

## Development Framework Requirements

### Web Framework
- Use Flask for maximum simplicity and minimal overhead
- Single Python file application preferred for initial implementation
- Static file serving for CSS/JS (if needed)
- No database requirements
- No containerization needed
